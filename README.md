# Data_Explore_Summarize

In this project I explored red wine data using R (mainly through the dplyr and ggplot2 packages). This was an interesting project for three reasons: 1) it showed me that I don't need big data to encounter challenges or valuable insights; 2) I need to stay vigilant so that what I infer is backed by the data and not just by how I think things should be; and 3) bias in the data (having too much of one category and not enough of another) can really hamper the accuracy of a predictive model.
